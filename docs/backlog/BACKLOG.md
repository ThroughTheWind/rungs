## The first-user path — WI-001…007, closed 2026-08-15

Opened from one assessment of what a person meets between `npx @rungs/cli doctor` and their first
work item, worked in id order, all merged. Each was reproduced by running the tool before it was
opened and re-verified before it was closed.

| Id | What it fixed |
| --- | --- |
| [WI-001](items/WI-001-infer-project-name.md) | Every scaffold's entry document opened `# AGENTS.md — ` with a dangling dash. The default now states its own derivation |
| [WI-002](items/WI-002-set-flag-parsing.md) | `--set k=v` silently became a positional and `--into` ate it, reporting the user's path as an unknown module |
| [WI-003](items/WI-003-render-reports-what-it-cannot-reemit.md) | `.ai/rungs.toml` told every scaffolded repo to do something no command performs |
| [WI-004](items/WI-004-help-completeness.md) | `--help` omitted a real command and three real flags, and exited 1 |
| [WI-005](items/WI-005-doctor-next-step.md) | The advertised entry point ended on fifteen `absent` lines with nothing to do next |
| [WI-006](items/WI-006-parameter-reference.md) | 43 parameters documented nowhere; now rendered from the manifests by `rungs modules --params` |
| [WI-007](items/WI-007-first-hour-guide.md) | No page addressed the reader holding a fresh scaffold |

Three of the items corrected a measurement in their own proposal during execution — an exit code
read from a pipeline, a count read from a truncated `head`, a link count taken on memory. Those
corrections are in the items, marked, rather than amended away.

Five findings were opened rather than folded in: F-001 (the merged-status gate fires on a
commitless branch, hit on four of seven items) and F-005 (`gates-links-resolve` passes on a broken
relative link) are the two worth acting on next. See [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md).

## Deferred

| Id | Title | Revisit when |

Rejected and completed items keep their files — see [`archive/`](archive/). A rejection is part of
the record, with its reason; deleting one loses the answer to "why not?" and invites the same
proposal again.
